The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used across all the .tsx files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all .tsx files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **React-DOM**: This is used in _document.tsx for server-side rendering of the React components.

5. **CSS**: The global CSS styles are shared across all the .tsx files.

6. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of all the dependencies used in the project, including Next.js, TypeScript, and React.

7. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the configuration for TypeScript, which is used across all .tsx files.

8. **Public assets**: The favicon.ico and vercel.svg files in the public directory are used across the application for displaying the favicon and the Vercel logo.

9. **_app.tsx**: This file is used for initializing pages. It has access to global CSS and can be used to share components across all pages.

10. **_document.tsx**: This file is used for server-side rendering. It can customize the HTML and body tags and is shared across all pages.

Please note that specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names would depend on the specific implementation of the application and are not included in this general overview.
